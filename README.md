# ML-project-6-book recommendation-system
I have completed a collaborative filtering classification project in which books are recommended based on the preferences of similar users. The project involved significant feature engineering, including merging multiple datasets to create a cohesive dataset. I then created a sparse matrix using a pivot table and employed the nearest neighbors classifier on the sparse matrix to calculate distances and generate suggestions for the 5 nearest books. This approach allows for personalized book recommendations, enhancing the user experience by leveraging the tastes of similar readers.

This is an ongoing project, and I plan to further enhance it by developing a user interface using Streamlit. This will make the recommendation system more accessible and user-friendly.
